          h2 Welcome on Fluid!
          h3 How does it work
          p
            | Fluid is a static website with a blog engine written in Node.js with Express. The blog engine is powered with MongoDB.
            | Webpages can be personnalized by editing the Jade views from the folder views of the main directory.
            | Configurations such as title, database, etc... are managed by the config.js file from the main directory.

          h3 Menu Navigation & Routes
          p
            | Adding, removing & editing routes of the website is managed in the config.js file. 
            | Add a JSON object with path, associated view and title in the array defining the routes key.
            | Example: 
            pre
              code "routes": [{"path": "/", "view": "index", "title": "Fluid"}]
            | Then create a jade view file. You can inspire yourself with the index view to create new ones.
          p
            | Enable the menu display by setting the 'enabled' attribute of menu in config.js. Then set the different elements of the menu
            | with the path of the routes you declared. 

          h3 Blog Engine
          p
            | Enable the blog engine by setting the 'enabled' attribute of blog in config.js. Not much is to be done, the route to the blog should be /blog.
